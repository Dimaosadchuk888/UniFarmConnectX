# UniFarm useState Error Analysis Report
**Date:** July 6, 2025  
**Status:** Non-critical error, interface loading successfully

## Executive Summary

The useState error (`TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'U.current.useState')`) occurs but does NOT prevent the application from loading and functioning. This indicates the error is either:
1. Caught by an error boundary
2. Occurring in a non-critical component
3. Related to development tooling (Vite HMR)

## Console Log Analysis

### Error Timeline
```
1751790728140 - TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'U.current.useState')
1751790862959 - 404 Error for guest user endpoint
1751790916093 - Vite WebSocket connection failed
```

### Working Features (from console logs)
- ✅ Main application loads
- ✅ WebSocket connection established and working
- ✅ Heartbeat ping/pong functioning (every 30 seconds)
- ✅ API calls returning data successfully
- ✅ User authentication working (user_id: 48)
- ✅ Referral data loading correctly

## Technical Analysis

### Minified Variable 'U.current'
- 'U' is a minified variable name from React's production build
- Typically represents React's internal `useRef` or similar hook reference
- The error suggests a hook is being called outside React's render cycle

### Possible Causes

1. **Race Condition in Provider Initialization**
   - WebSocketProvider's useEffect with setTimeout(0) might be too early
   - Some component might be trying to use context before it's ready

2. **Third-party Library Issue**
   - Could be from @tonconnect/ui-react or another library
   - Libraries sometimes have initialization issues with React 18

3. **Development vs Production Mismatch**
   - Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) failing to connect
   - Development-only code trying to execute

4. **Guest User Flow**
   - 404 error for guest user suggests authentication flow issue
   - May be trying to use hooks before user context is established

## Evidence from Logs

### What's Working
```javascript
// WebSocket successfully connected and maintaining connection
[WebSocket] Подключение установлено
[WebSocket] Heartbeat ping отправлен
[WebSocket] Heartbeat pong получен

// API calls successful
/api/v2/referrals/stats - returning full data
```

### What's Failing
```javascript
// useState error (non-blocking)
TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'U.current.useState')

// Guest user endpoint not found
404: /api/users/guest/guest_1751710404084_lcqta8gqx

// Vite development WebSocket
[vite] failed to connect to websocket
```

## Hypothesis

The error is likely coming from one of these scenarios:

1. **TonConnect UI Library** - May have initialization issues with React 18 StrictMode
2. **Vite Development Server** - HMR trying to use hooks incorrectly
3. **Guest User Authentication** - Attempting to use user context before it's ready

## Why the App Still Works

- React's error boundaries are catching and containing the error
- The error occurs in a non-critical path (possibly development tooling)
- The main application logic continues after the error

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Check Browser Network Tab**
   - Look for failed resource loads
   - Check if any JavaScript chunks are failing

2. **Inspect Error Stack Trace**
   - In browser DevTools, click on the error to see full stack trace
   - This will show exactly which component/file is causing the issue

3. **Test in Production Build**
   - Run `npm run build && npm run preview`
   - If error disappears, it's development-related

4. **Check React DevTools**
   - Install React Developer Tools extension
   - Look for components showing errors or warnings

## Conclusion

The useState error is non-critical and doesn't prevent the application from functioning. The interface loads successfully, WebSocket connections work, and API calls complete. This suggests the error is either:
- Contained by error boundaries
- Related to development tooling (Vite HMR)
- Occurring in an optional component path

Since the user confirmed the interface loads and works, this error can be considered low priority unless it affects specific functionality.
