# TypeScript Errors Complete Resolution Report
## UniFarm Project - Final Error Fixes

### ✅ COMPLETED: All TypeScript Errors Successfully Resolved

This document summarizes the comprehensive TypeScript error resolution completed across the entire UniFarm project.

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. Notification Context Import Path Issues (Case-Sensitivity)
**Problem**: Components were importing from `@/contexts/notificationContext` instead of `@/contexts/NotificationContext`
**Solution**: Updated all import statements to use correct case-sensitive path
**Files Fixed**:
- `client/src/components/farming/UniFarmingCard.tsx`
- `client/src/components/wallet/BalanceCard.tsx`  
- `client/src/components/wallet/WithdrawalForm.tsx`
- `client/src/components/wallet/ConnectWalletButton.tsx`
- `client/src/components/wallet/WalletConnectionCard.tsx`

### 2. Notification API Method Calls Updated
**Problem**: Components were using old `showNotification(type, {message, duration})` API
**Solution**: Updated to new simplified API methods: `success()`, `error()`, `info()`, `loading()`
**Files Fixed**: All notification-using components converted to new API

### 3. Missing Type Definition Added
**Problem**: `InsertUser` type was not exported from core types
**Solution**: Added proper type export in `client/src/core/types/index.ts`

### 4. Type Assertion Issues Fixed
**Problem**: Service modules had incorrect type assertions for API responses
**Solution**: Fixed type assertions in:
- `client/src/modules/farming/farmingService.ts`
- `client/src/modules/wallet/walletService.ts`
- `client/src/modules/referral/referralService.ts`

## Key Achievements
