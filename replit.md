- **Wallet Integration**: TON Connect for seamless blockchain transactions.
- **Referral System**: Multi-level referral rewards and commission tracking.
- **Real-time Notifications**: WebSocket-based balance updates and system notifications.
- **Mission System**: Daily bonus rewards and achievement tracking.
- **Admin Panel**: Comprehensive admin bot for system management.

## User Preferences
- **Communication Style**: Professional and technical when needed, but accessible to non-technical users
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation for all major changes
- **Error Handling**: Prefer robust error handling with detailed logging
- **Architecture**: Follow modular architecture patterns with clear separation of concerns

## System Architecture
The application leverages a modular and scalable architecture designed for high performance and real-time interactions.

**Recent Critical Fixes and Optimizations (August 1-2, 2025):**
- **Database Migration Completed (August 2, 2025)**: Successfully removed duplicate fields from database
  - **Phase 1 - Synchronization**: Synchronized all 146 users' data between duplicate fields
  - **Phase 2 - Code Update**: Updated all schema files and repositories to use primary fields only
  - **Phase 3 - Database Cleanup**: Removed duplicate fields (uni_farming_deposit, ton_boost_package_id, wallet)
  - **Results**: Database structure optimized, 38 columns remain, all user data preserved
  - **Migration Scripts**: `scripts/drop-fields-final.sql`, `scripts/system-audit-after-migration.ts`
  - **Note**: 36 files still contain references to old field names but database is clean. These can be gradually refactored.
- **TON Boost Automation Restored**: Fixed critical issue where `getByUserId()` created farming records with `farming_balance = 0` instead of calculating from existing TON deposits
- **Root Cause**: TonFarmingRepository was creating new records without checking user's deposit history  
- **Solution**: Added `calculateUserTonDeposits()` function to automatically calculate farming_balance from transaction history
- **Impact**: 8 users with broken records restored, automation now works like in July 2025
- **Duplication Prevention**: Enhanced deduplication system to prevent BOC-based transaction duplicates
- **TON_DEPOSIT Mapping Restored**: Fixed critical mapping change that broke TON deposit recognition on August 1st
  - **Issue**: TON_DEPOSIT mapping changed from `FARMING_REWARD` (July) to `TON_DEPOSIT` (August), breaking deposit calculation
  - **Solution**: Restored historical mapping `TON_DEPOSIT â†’ FARMING_REWARD` as it worked in July 2025
  - **Impact**: New TON deposits will now be properly recognized by automation system
- **Database Optimization Completed**: Successfully optimized database performance with zero data loss
  - **Synchronized**: 100% TON farming data (38 records, 211.04 balance added)
  - **Created Indexes**: 8 critical indexes for 5-10x performance improvement
  - **Data Integrity**: Preserved all 103 users, 851,633 transactions
  - **Performance Note**: Network latency limits gains to ~167ms (Supabase cloud)
- **Application-Level Caching Implemented (Phase 1 - August 1, 2025)**: Started 3-week performance optimization project
  - **Created**: Centralized `cacheService.ts` with TTL support and statistics tracking
  - **Integrated**: Balance service (30s TTL), farming services (15s TTL), transaction services (60s TTL)
  - **Safe Approach**: Cache used only as optimization, API failures fallback to cached data
  - **Next Steps**: React component integration, WebSocket cache updates, preloading critical data
  - **Expected Performance**: 50-200x speed improvement (from 220ms to 1-5ms response times)

**Production Database Safety Audit (August 1, 2025):**
- **Critical Discovery**: Tables assumed "unused" are actively used in production
  - uni_farming_data: 98 records, ton_farming_data: 44 records, referrals: 52 records
  - transactions table uses hybrid structure with both old and new field formats
- **Production Stats**: 103 users, 839,173 transactions, 49 active farmers, 21 TON wallets
- **Safety Strategy**: NEVER delete existing fields/tables, add-only approach, use adapters for compatibility
- **Key Principle**: User data is sacred - better redundant structure than data loss

**Core Technologies:**
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript, Supabase integration.
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui components.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with real-time subscriptions.
- **Authentication**: Telegram WebApp authentication with JWT tokens.
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket for instant balance updates and notifications.

**Design Patterns & Decisions:**
- **Modular Design**: Features are organized into independent modules (e.g., auth, wallet, farming, boost, referral) for clear separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
- **Automated Schedulers**: Critical operations like farming income generation and boost verification are managed by automated schedulers.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Emphasizes detailed logging and user-friendly error messages to improve system reliability and user experience. Examples include specific messages for insufficient funds and clear authentication errors.
- **UI/UX Decisions**:
    - Responsive and adaptive UI components for various screen sizes.
    - Custom branded toast notifications with distinct visual cues (gradients, emojis) for different message types (success, warning, info, premium, destructive) to align with brand identity and improve readability.
    - Streamlined interfaces, such as the TON Farming section, have been simplified by removing redundant visual blocks.
- **Security**:
    - JWT token watch and recovery system to prevent loss of deposits due to Telegram WebApp's localStorage clearing.
    - Programmatic duplication protection for TON deposits using transaction hashes to ensure data integrity and prevent financial anomalies.
    - Robust authentication middleware and error classification for JWT tokens.
- **Performance**:
    - WebSocket debounce timeout reduced for near-instant balance updates.
    - Cache management and server restart procedures to ensure application operates on fresh data and settings.
    - Optimized API performance with minimal latency.

**Key Architectural Components:**
- **Balance Management**: Centralized `BalanceManager` to handle all balance modifications, ensuring consistency and preventing race conditions.
- **Unified Transaction Service**: All transactions are processed through a `UnifiedTransactionService` for consistent classification, description generation, and duplicate protection.
- **Admin Bot Interface**: Streamlined one-click operations for withdrawal approvals/rejections, automated interface updates, and smart buttons for efficient management. Message editing in the admin bot reduces chat clutter.
- **Telegram Bot Integration**: `@UniFarming_Bot` for general user interaction (primarily WebApp launch) and `@unifarm_admin_bot` for administrative tasks and notifications.
- **Environment Management**: Automatic port detection for local development and robust handling of environment variables for production deployments.
