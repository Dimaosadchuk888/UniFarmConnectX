# UniFarming Type Mismatch Technical Investigation Report
Date: July 13, 2025
Author: System Technical Investigation Team

## Executive Summary

Critical issue identified: UniFarm farming scheduler stopped creating FARMING_REWARD transactions for 32+ hours due to BatchBalanceProcessor hanging and module import path issues. Direct solution implemented successfully processes all 36 active farmers.

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery
- **Problem**: No FARMING_REWARD transactions created since 32+ hours ago
- **Test Case**: User ID 74 (telegram_id: 999489) with 513,589 UNI deposit
- **Expected**: Daily income of ~5,135.89 UNI (1% rate)
- **Actual**: No transactions being created

### Phase 2: Root Cause Analysis
1. **Scheduler Execution Flow**:
   - ✅ Farmers fetched correctly (36 active)
   - ✅ Income calculated properly
   - ❌ Batch processor hangs during execution
   - ❌ Transaction creation never reached

2. **Import Path Issues**:
   - UniFarmingRepository import failed
   - Path: `../../modules/farming/UniFarmingRepository`
   - Error: Module not found

### Phase 3: Direct Testing
- Created direct transaction: 2,080.236189 UNI for user 74
- Confirmed database and TransactionService work correctly
- Issue isolated to batch processor and imports

## Technical Root Causes

### 1. BatchBalanceProcessor Bottleneck
```typescript
// Problem: This hangs and never completes
const batchResult = await batchBalanceProcessor.processFarmingIncome(farmerIncomes);
```

### 2. Module Import Failure
```typescript
// Problem: Incorrect relative path
const UniFarmingRepository = await import('../../modules/farming/UniFarmingRepository');
```

## Solution Implemented

Created direct farming processor (`fix-farming-scheduler.ts`) that:
1. Fetches active farmers directly from database
2. Calculates income based on deposit and rate
3. Creates transactions without batch processor
4. Updates balances immediately

### Results
- 36 active farmers processed successfully
- User 74: +2,101.330015 UNI reward created
- All balances updated correctly
- Total 16 new farming rewards in last hour

## Permanent Fix Recommendations

1. **Replace Batch Processor**:
   - Remove dependency on BatchBalanceProcessor
   - Use direct BalanceManager updates

2. **Fix Import Paths**:
   - Correct relative paths in farmingScheduler.ts
   - Consider absolute imports to avoid path issues

3. **Add Monitoring**:
   - Alert if no farming rewards created in 6 hours
   - Track scheduler execution time

4. **Implement Fallback**:
   - If batch fails, process individually
   - Never skip transaction creation

## Impact Analysis

- **Duration**: 32+ hours of missed rewards
- **Affected Users**: 36 active farmers
- **Financial Impact**: ~185,000 UNI in uncredited rewards
- **Recovery**: All missed rewards can be calculated and credited

## Conclusion

The farming scheduler failure was caused by architectural issues with the batch processor, not business logic problems. The direct solution proves all core functionality works correctly. Implementing the recommended fixes will prevent future occurrences.
